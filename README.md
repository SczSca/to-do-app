### Features

The To-do List application includes the following features to help manage tasks efficiently:

- **Create To-do Items**: Users can create a new to-do item by specifying a name, priority, and optionally a due date.

- **Edit To-do Items**: Users can update the name, priority, and due date of existing to-do tasks. They can also clear the due date if it's no longer relevant.

- **Filter To-do Items**: Users can filter the to-do list based on the name (or part of the name), priority, and completion status (done/undone).

- **Sort To-do Items**: Users can sort to-do items by priority and/or due date. This allows for organizing tasks based on urgency and deadlines.

- **Mark as Done/Undone**: Users can mark to-do items as done by clicking a checkbox. There is also an option to mark items as undone if necessary.

- **Pagination**: The application supports pagination to manage a large number of to-do items efficiently.

- **Performance Metrics**: The application calculates and displays the average time between the creation and completion of to-do items. This metric is available both in general and grouped by priority to help measure performance.

#### Base Endpoint
All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/tasks`.

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/tasks/search/prior/{prior}/status/{status}/text/{text}/page/{page}/dateAsc/{isDateAsc}/priorAsc/{isPriorAsc}`  
**Description**: Fetch a list of tasks with pagination and various filtering options.

- `isPriorAsc` (String): Sort tasks by priority in ascending (`true`) or descending (`false`) order.

#### Get Time Metrics
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/tasks/time`  
**Description**: Retrieve performance metrics showing the average time between task creation and completion. This metric is displayed both in general and grouped by priority.

#### Create Task
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/tasks`  
**Description**: Create a new task with the following fields: name, priority, and due date (optional).  
**Request Body**: `TaskDTO` object containing the task details.
